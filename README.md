## <p align="left" style="color: crimson">What is Anubis</p>
Anubis is a tabletop rpg game still under development, it was born as a management tool for D&D homebrew campaigns and as a way of teaching node to myself, but is now an ambitious project which I intend making into a full game in the near future.

The name was inspired by the ancient egyptian deity Anubis, which is the god of the dead and that who guides the deceased to the afterlife, just like a game master does.

- Character management (inventory, skills and atributes)
- Combat simulation (encounter simulation)

- Open to new features and feature modifications
