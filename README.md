  <p align="center">A tabletop rpg management tool created out of need to improve a dungeon master's work and help players keep track of their characters and adventures. Might become a full game. Maybe.</p>

## <p align="left" style="color: crimson">Description</p>

This project was created for studying purposes, as a way to learn and improve my nodejs/nestjs skills, but also as a way to help me, as a tabletop rpg DM, manage my RPG sessions. <br/>
The main goal here is to create a tool that's capable of:
- Character creation (heroes, NPCs and enemies)
- Character management (inventory, skills and atributes)
- Combat simulation (encounter simulation)
- Dice rolling
- History tracking
- Open to new features and feature modifications

As for now, only the backend will be done, but I do intend on creating a frontend in the near future. Also, in the not so near future, this will be migrated to a microservices architecture.
